# Usage Specifications

This guide provides instructions for using the Sports Fest ChMeetings Integration system, including the Windows middleware and WordPress plugin.
(Not all features are fully work yet, especially for 1.0 release. Currently the middleware can sync data to WordPress then send/process Pastor Approvals).

## Windows Middleware

### Running Synchronization Tasks

The middleware provides several synchronization commands through the `main.py` script:

#### Full Synchronization

To run a complete synchronization of all data:

```bash
python main.py sync --type full
```

This will perform:
- Church synchronization from Excel
- Participant synchronization from ChMeetings
- Validation and roster creation
- Approval token generation
- Approval sync to ChMeetings

#### Churches Sync

To sync only church data from an Excel file:

```bash
python main.py sync-churches --file "data/Church Application Form.xlsx"
```

You can specify a different Excel file if needed:

```bash
python main.py sync-churches --file "path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx"
```

#### Participants Sync

To sync only participant data:

```bash
python main.py sync --type participants
```

#### Approvals Generation

To generate approval tokens for participants who have completed validation:

```bash
python main.py sync --type approvals
```

This will create tokens and send approval emails to pastors.

#### Validation

To run validation without other sync operations:

```bash
python main.py sync --type validation
```

### Scheduled Syncs

For automatic synchronization at regular intervals:

```bash
# Run sync every 60 minutes
python main.py schedule --interval 60

# Run as a background process (daemon)
python main.py schedule --interval 60 --daemon
```

To set up as a Windows scheduled task:

1. Create a batch file (e.g., `run-sync.bat`):
   ```
   @echo off
   cd %USERPROFILE%\vaysf-middleware
   call venv\Scripts\activate
   python main.py sync --type full
   ```

2. Use Windows Task Scheduler to run this batch file at desired intervals.

### Testing Connectivity

To test system connectivity:

```bash
# Test all connections
python main.py test --system all --test-type connectivity

# Test only WordPress connection
python main.py test --system wordpress --test-type connectivity

# Test only ChMeetings connection
python main.py test --system chmeetings --test-type connectivity
```

To test email functionality:

```bash
python main.py test --system wordpress --test-type email --test-email "test@example.com"
```

## WordPress Plugin

### Admin Dashboard

After logging into WordPress admin, navigate to the Sports Fest menu in the sidebar to access:

- **Dashboard**: Overview of statistics and quick actions
- **Churches**: Church management and approval status
- **Participants**: Participant management and approval status
- **Rosters**: Sport roster management
- **Approvals**: Pastor approval token management
- **Validation**: Validation issue tracking and resolution
- **Settings**: System configuration

### Managing Churches

The Churches page displays all participating churches with their details:

- **Add Church**: Manually add a church (usually done via sync)
- **Edit Church**: Update church details including pastor and rep info
- **View Participants**: Filter participants by church
- **Church Sync**: Trigger church sync from Excel

### Managing Participants

The Participants page shows all registered participants:

- **Filter Options**: Filter by church, approval status, or sport
- **Edit Participant**: Update participant details
- **View Approvals**: Check approval status
- **Participant Sync**: Trigger participant sync from ChMeetings

Church representatives can be identified by the "Church Rep" role in the system.

### Managing Rosters

The Rosters page manages sport roster entries:

- **Filter Options**: Filter by church, sport, or format
- **Add Roster Entry**: Manually add roster entry
- **Edit Roster Entry**: Update roster details
- **Delete Roster Entry**: Remove participant from a sport

### Handling Validation Issues

The Validation Issues page helps identify and resolve participant eligibility issues:

- **Filter Options**: Filter by church, severity, rule level, or sport
- **Severity Levels**: ERROR (blocks participation), WARNING (informational)
- **Resolution**: Mark issues as resolved once addressed
- **Bulk Actions**: Resolve or reopen multiple issues at once

Common validation issues include:
- Age restrictions (too young/old for a sport)
- Gender mismatches (wrong gender for gender-specific sports)
- Missing consent forms
- Missing profile photos

### Pastor Approval Process

The Approval workflow works as follows:

1. Participant registers in ChMeetings
2. Church Rep verifies their eligibility
3. Middleware generates approval token
4. WordPress sends approval email to pastor
5. Pastor clicks approve/deny link in email
6. WordPress records decision
7. Middleware syncs approval status back to ChMeetings

The Approvals page allows you to:
- View pending/completed approvals
- Resend approval emails
- Generate new tokens
- Check token expiry dates
